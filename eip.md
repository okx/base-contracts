## Abstract

This specification defines the **Agentic Commerce Protocol**: a **job** with escrowed budget, four states (Open → Funded → Submitted → Terminal), and an **evaluator** who alone may mark the job completed. The client funds the job; the provider submits work; the evaluator attests completion or rejection once submitted (or the evaluator rejects while Funded before submission, or the client rejects while Open, or the job expires and the client is refunded). Optional attestation **reason** (e.g. hash) on complete/reject enables audit and composition with reputation (e.g. [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md)).

## Motivation

Many use cases need only: client locks funds, provider submits work, one attester (evaluator) signals "done" and triggers payment—or client rejects or timeout triggers refund. The Agentic Commerce Protocol specifies that minimal surface so implementations stay small and composable. The evaluator can be the client (e.g. `evaluator = client` at creation) when there is no third-party attester.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### State Machine

A **job** has exactly one of six states:


| State         | Meaning                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open**      | Created; budget not yet set or not yet funded. Client may set budget, then fund or reject.                        |
| **Funded**    | Budget escrowed. Provider may submit work; evaluator may reject. After `expiredAt`, anyone may trigger refund.    |
| **Submitted** | Provider has submitted work. Only evaluator may complete or reject. After `expiredAt`, anyone may trigger refund. |
| **Completed** | Terminal. Escrow released to provider (minus optional platform fee).                                              |
| **Rejected**  | Terminal. Escrow refunded to client.                                                                              |
| **Expired**   | Terminal. Same as Rejected; escrow refunded to client.                                                            |


Allowed transitions:

- **Open → Funded**: Client or provider calls `setBudget(jobId, token, amount)` to agree on price and payment token, then client calls `fund(jobId, expectedBudget)`; contract pulls `job.budget` of the job's payment token from client into escrow.
- **Open → Rejected**: Client or provider calls `reject(jobId, reason?)`.
- **Open → Expired**: When `block.timestamp >= job.expiredAt`, anyone may call `claimRefund(jobId)`; contract sets state to Expired. No refund to client as job has not been funded yet.
- **Funded → Submitted**: Provider calls `submit(jobId, deliverable)`; signals that work has been completed and is ready for evaluation.
- **Funded → Rejected**: Evaluator calls `reject(jobId, reason?)`; contract refunds client.
- **Funded → Expired**: When `block.timestamp >= job.expiredAt`, anyone may call `claimRefund(jobId)`; contract sets state to Expired and refunds client.
- **Submitted → Completed**: Evaluator calls `complete(jobId, reason?)`; contract distributes escrow to provider (and optional platform/evaluator fees).
- **Submitted → Rejected**: Evaluator calls `reject(jobId, reason?)`; contract refunds client.
- **Submitted → Expired**: When `block.timestamp >= job.expiredAt + EVALUATION_GRACE_PERIOD`, anyone may call `claimRefund(jobId)`; contract sets state to Expired and refunds client. The grace period (e.g. 1 hour in the reference implementation) protects an evaluator who is mid-review from being censored by a third-party refund call. Implementations MAY set the grace period length or omit it entirely.

No other transitions are valid.

### Roles

- **Client**: Creates job (with description), may set provider via `setProvider(jobId, provider, agentId?)` when job was created with no provider, funds escrow with `fund(jobId, expectedBudget)`, may reject when status is Open. Receives refund on Rejected/Expired. **MUST NOT be the provider** — an address cannot hold both client and provider roles on the same job.
- **Provider**: Set at creation or later via `setProvider`. Calls `setBudget(jobId, token, amount)` to propose a price and payment token. Calls `submit(jobId, deliverable)` when work is done to move the job from Funded to Submitted for evaluation. May reject when status is Open (e.g. to decline the engagement before any escrow is locked). Receives payment when job is Completed. Does not call `complete` or `reject` once the job has been funded.
- **Evaluator**: Single address per job, set at creation. When status is Submitted, **only** the evaluator MAY call `complete(jobId, reason?)` or `reject(jobId, reason?)`. When status is Funded, the evaluator MAY call `reject(jobId, reason?)` (before submission). MAY be the client (e.g. `evaluator = client`) so the client can complete or reject the job without a third party, or MAY be a **smart contract** that performs arbitrary checks (e.g. verifying a zero‑knowledge proof or aggregating off‑chain signals) before deciding whether to call `complete` or `reject` on the job. **MUST NOT be the provider** — an address cannot hold both roles on the same job.

### Job Data

Each job SHALL have at least:

- `client`, `provider`, `evaluator` (addresses). **Provider MAY be zero at creation** (see Optional provider below).
- `description` (string) — set at creation (e.g. job brief, scope reference).
- `budget` (uint256)
- `expiredAt` (uint256 timestamp)
- `status` (Open | Funded | Submitted | Completed | Rejected | Expired)
- `paymentToken` (address) — the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token used for payment on this job, set via `setBudget`.
- `hook` (address) — OPTIONAL. External hook contract called before and after core functions (see Hooks below). MAY be `address(0)` (no hook).
- `payoutReceiver` (address) — OPTIONAL. Provider-side payout recipient. MAY be `address(0)` to pay the provider directly.
- `providerAgentId` (uint256) — OPTIONAL. When non-zero, references an agent identity in an [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md) registry, enabling on-chain identity binding for reputation. Set via `setProvider` (or at creation if provider is known). Default `0` (unset).

Each job has its own [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) payment token. The token address is set alongside the amount when `setBudget` is called. This allows different jobs on the same contract to use different tokens.

### Optional provider (set later)

Jobs MAY be created **without a provider** by passing `provider = address(0)` to `createJob`. In that case the client SHALL set the provider later via `setProvider(jobId, provider, agentId?)` before funding. This supports flows such as bidding or assignment after creation.

- **setProvider(jobId, provider, agentId?)**
Called by **client** only. SHALL revert if job is not Open, the job has expired, the current `job.provider != address(0)`, `provider == address(0)`, or `provider == job.evaluator`. SHALL set `job.provider = provider`. `agentId` is the provider's [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md) agent identity; if non-zero, the contract MAY verify that `provider` is the owner or operator of that agentId on the ERC-8004 registry, and SHALL set `job.providerAgentId = agentId`. SHALL emit an event (e.g. ProviderSet) including the agentId. Implementations MAY allow an operator role to call setProvider in the future; this specification only requires client-only for the minimal protocol.
- **fund(jobId, expectedBudget)**
SHALL revert if `job.provider == address(0)` (provider MUST be set before funding) or if `job.budget != expectedBudget` (front-running protection).

### Core Functions

- **createJob(provider, evaluator, expiredAt, description, hook?, payoutReceiver?, providerAgentId?)**
Called by client. Creates job in Open with `client = msg.sender`, `provider`, `evaluator`, `expiredAt`, `description`, optional `hook` address, and optional `payoutReceiver`. SHALL revert if `evaluator` is zero, if `expiredAt` is not at least 5 minutes in the future, if `provider == evaluator`, or if `msg.sender == provider`. **Provider MAY be zero**; if so, client MUST call `setProvider` before `fund`. `hook` MAY be `address(0)` (no hook); if non-zero, the hook MUST be admin-whitelisted and SHOULD advertise support for the `IERC8183Hook` interface via ERC-165. `payoutReceiver` MAY be `address(0)` to pay the provider directly. `providerAgentId` is the provider's [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md) agent identity; if `provider` is non-zero and `providerAgentId` is non-zero, SHALL set `job.providerAgentId = providerAgentId`; the contract MAY verify that `provider` is the owner or operator of that `providerAgentId` on the ERC-8004 registry. Returns `jobId`.
- **setProvider(jobId, provider, agentId?)**
Called by client. SHALL revert if job is not Open, has expired, current `job.provider != address(0)`, `provider == address(0)`, or `provider == job.evaluator`. SHALL set `job.provider = provider`. `agentId` is the provider's [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md) agent identity; if non-zero, SHALL set `job.providerAgentId = agentId`; the contract MAY verify that `provider` is the owner or operator of that agentId on the ERC-8004 registry.
- **setBudget(jobId, token, amount, optParams?)**
Called by the job's provider. Sets `job.paymentToken = token` and `job.budget = amount`. SHALL revert if job is not Open, has expired, caller is not the provider, or `token` is the zero address. Implementations SHOULD restrict `token` to an admin-managed allowlist of tokens with vetted ERC-20 semantics, to reject tokens that would break escrow accounting (e.g. fee-on-transfer, rebasing, transfer-hooked, pausable, or blacklist tokens); the reference implementation reverts with `PaymentTokenNotAllowed` for tokens not on the allowlist. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **fund(jobId, expectedBudget, optParams?)**
Called by client. SHALL revert if job is not Open, caller is not client, **provider is not set** (`job.provider == address(0)`), `job.budget != expectedBudget` (front-running protection), or job has expired (`block.timestamp >= expiredAt`). SHALL transfer `job.budget` of the job's payment token (`job.paymentToken`) from client to the contract (escrow) and set status to Funded. Implementations SHOULD verify that the contract's balance increased by exactly `job.budget` and revert otherwise, to defend against fee-on-transfer and rebasing tokens that would silently leave the escrow short; the reference implementation reverts with `UnexpectedFundedAmount` in that case. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **submit(jobId, deliverable, optParams?)**
Called by provider only. SHALL revert if caller is not the job's provider, or if `job.expiredAt > 0` and the job has expired. SHALL revert if job is not Funded, unless the job is Open with `budget == 0` (zero-budget job, no escrow needed). SHALL set status to Submitted and SHOULD record `submittedAt = block.timestamp` for grace-period accounting. `deliverable` (`bytes32`) is a reference to submitted work (e.g. hash of off-chain deliverable, IPFS CID, attestation commitment). SHALL emit an event including `deliverable` (e.g. JobSubmitted). `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **complete(jobId, reason, optParams?)**
Called by evaluator only. SHALL revert if job is not Submitted or caller is not the job's evaluator. SHALL set status to Completed. SHALL transfer escrowed funds to provider, minus optional platform fee to a configurable treasury and optional evaluator fee paid to the evaluator address. `reason` MAY be `bytes32(0)` or an attestation hash (OPTIONAL). SHALL emit an event including `reason` if provided. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **reject(jobId, reason, optParams?)**
Called by **client or provider when job is Open**, or by **evaluator when job is Funded or Submitted**. SHALL revert if job is not Open, Funded, or Submitted, or if the caller is not authorised for the current status. SHALL set status to Rejected. If Funded or Submitted, SHALL refund escrow to client. `reason` OPTIONAL. SHALL emit an event including `reason` and the caller (rejector) if provided. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **claimRefund(jobId)**
Callable by anyone when status is Open, Funded, or Submitted. SHALL revert if status is Open or Funded and `block.timestamp < job.expiredAt`. SHALL revert if status is Submitted and `block.timestamp < job.expiredAt + EVALUATION_GRACE_PERIOD` (the grace period protects an evaluator who is mid-review from being censored by a third-party refund call; implementations MAY set the grace period length or omit it). SHALL set status to Expired. If the prior status was Funded or Submitted and `budget > 0`, SHALL transfer the full escrow to the client. SHALL NOT be hookable.

### Attestation

- **complete(jobId, reason, optParams?)**: `reason` is an optional attestation commitment (e.g. `bytes32` hash of off-chain evidence). Implementations MAY use `string` and hash it internally. Events SHOULD include `reason` for indexing and composition with reputation systems. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.
- **reject(jobId, reason, optParams?)**: Optional `reason` for audit; same treatment as above. `optParams` forwarded to hook if set.

### Fees

Implementations MAY charge a **platform fee** and/or an **evaluator fee** (both in basis points) on Completed. The platform fee is paid to a configurable treasury; the evaluator fee is paid to the job's evaluator address. The specification does not require either fee. If present, fees SHALL be deducted only on completion (not on refund).

### Hooks (OPTIONAL)

Implementations MAY support an optional **hook contract** per job to extend the core protocol without modifying it. The hook address is set at job creation (or `address(0)` for no hook) and stored on the job. A **non-hooked kernel** that ignores the `hook` field (or always sets it to `address(0)`) is fully compliant with this specification. The reference `ERC8183` contract supports both modes in a single contract: jobs with `hook == address(0)` skip all callbacks, and jobs with a whitelisted hook receive `beforeAction` / `afterAction` callbacks on the hookable functions listed below.

A hook contract SHALL implement the `IERC8183Hook` interface — just two functions:

```solidity
interface IERC8183Hook {
    function beforeAction(uint256 jobId, bytes4 selector, bytes calldata data) external;
    function afterAction(uint256 jobId, bytes4 selector, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

The `selector` parameter identifies which core function is being called (e.g. the function selector for `fund`). The `data` parameter contains function-specific parameters encoded as bytes (see Data encoding below). The hook uses the selector to route internally:

```solidity
function beforeAction(uint256 jobId, bytes4 selector, bytes calldata data) external {
    if (selector == FUND_SELECTOR) {
        // custom pre-fund logic using data (optParams)
    } else if (selector == COMPLETE_SELECTOR) {
        // custom pre-complete logic using data (reason, optParams)
    }
}
```

When a job has a hook set, the core contract SHALL call `hook.beforeAction(...)` and `hook.afterAction(...)` around each hookable function. `createJob` is intentionally not hookable in the reference implementation — the hook is stored on the job, but no callbacks fire on creation. Implementations MAY add an `afterAction`-only callback for `createJob` if they need post-creation bookkeeping; conformant non-hooked kernels simply ignore the field.

| Core function  | Hookable |
| -------------- | -------- |
| `createJob`    | **No** — hook is stored on the job but no callback fires on creation in the reference implementation |
| `setProvider`  | **No**   |
| `setBudget`    | Yes      |
| `fund`         | Yes      |
| `submit`       | Yes      |
| `complete`     | Yes      |
| `reject`       | Yes      |
| `claimRefund`  | **No** — permissionless safety mechanism, SHALL NOT be hookable |

#### Data encoding

The `data` parameter passed to hooks contains the core function's parameters encoded as bytes. The encoding per selector:

| Core function  | `data` encoding                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `setBudget`    | `abi.encode(address caller, address token, uint256 amount, bytes optParams)` |
| `fund`         | `abi.encode(address caller, bytes optParams)`         |
| `submit`       | `abi.encode(address caller, bytes32 deliverable, bytes optParams)` |
| `complete`     | `abi.encode(address caller, bytes32 reason, bytes optParams)` |
| `reject`       | `abi.encode(address caller, bytes32 reason, bytes optParams)` |

#### Hook behaviour

- The `optParams` field (`bytes`, OPTIONAL) on each hookable core function is an opaque payload forwarded to the hook via the `data` parameter. Callers that do not use hooks MAY pass empty bytes. The core contract SHALL NOT interpret `optParams`; it is for the hook only.
- **Before hooks** (`beforeAction`) are called before the core logic executes. A before hook MAY revert to block the action (e.g. enforce custom validation, allowlists, or preconditions).
- **After hooks** (`afterAction`) are called after the core logic completes (including state changes and token transfers). An after hook MAY perform side effects (e.g. emit events, update external state, trigger notifications) or revert to roll back the entire transaction.
- If `job.hook == address(0)`, the core contract SHALL skip hook calls and execute normally.

#### Hook security

- Hooks are **trusted** contracts chosen by the client at job creation. A malicious or buggy hook can revert valid actions or execute arbitrary logic in callbacks. Clients SHOULD audit or use well-known hook implementations.
- **Liveness:** A reverting hook can block all hookable actions for that job until `expiredAt`. This is by design — the hook is part of the job's policy. The guaranteed recovery path is `claimRefund` after expiry, which is deliberately **not hookable** so that refunds cannot be blocked.
- **Atomicity:** After-callbacks run after state changes but within the same transaction. If an after-callback reverts, the entire transaction (including the core state change) is rolled back. This is intentional — it enables atomic multi-step flows (e.g. escrow funding + side token transfer must both succeed or both revert).
- `onlyERC8183` modifiers on hooks are RECOMMENDED so that hook functions cannot be called directly by external actors.
- Hooks SHOULD NOT be upgradeable after a job is created, as this would allow the hook to change behaviour mid-job.
- Implementations MAY maintain an allowlist or registry of audited hook contracts to reduce risk for clients.

#### Convenience base contract (non-normative)

Implementations MAY provide a `BaseERC8183Hook` that routes the generic `beforeAction`/`afterAction` calls to named virtual functions (e.g. `_preFund`, `_postComplete`) so hook developers only override what they need. This is NOT part of the standard — only `IERC8183Hook` is normative.

#### Example use cases

- Pre-fund validation (e.g. KYC check, allowlist gate)
- Post-complete reputation updates (e.g. writing attestations to ERC-8004)
- Custom fee logic or payment splitting
- Atomic side transfers (e.g. fund transfer hook)
- Provider bidding (e.g. bidding hook)

---

#### Example 1 — Fund Transfer Hook (two-phase escrow)

**Problem:** A client hires an agent to convert/bridge/swap tokens (e.g. USDC → DAI). The client provides capital to the provider, who uses it to produce output tokens. The hook must ensure the provider deposits the output tokens before the job completes, then release them to the designated buyer.

**Solution:** A `FundTransferHook` that (a) stores a transfer commitment at `setBudget`, (b) forwards capital to the provider at `fund`, (c) pulls output tokens from the provider at `submit`, and (d) releases them to the buyer at `complete`.

```
Step 1 — createJob
  Client → createJob(provider, evaluator, expiredAt, desc, hook=FundTransferHook, payoutReceiver=address(0))
  Job created (Open), hook address stored.

Step 2 — setBudget
  Client → setBudget(jobId, USDC, serviceFee, optParams=abi.encode(buyer, transferAmount))
    → hook.beforeAction: decode optParams, store {buyer, transferAmount} as commitment.
    → core: job.paymentToken = USDC, job.budget = serviceFee

Step 3 — fund
  Client approves: core contract for serviceFee, hook for transferAmount.
  Client → fund(jobId, serviceFee, "")
    → hook.beforeAction: verify client approved hook for transferAmount. Revert if not.
    → core: pull serviceFee into escrow, set Funded.
    → hook.afterAction: pull transferAmount from client, forward to provider (capital).

Step 4 — provider uses capital to produce output tokens

Step 5 — submit
  Provider approves hook for transferAmount (output tokens).
  Provider → submit(jobId, deliverable, "")
    → hook.beforeAction: pull transferAmount from provider into hook (escrow).
    → core: set Submitted.

Step 6 — complete
  Evaluator → complete(jobId, reason, "")
    → core: release serviceFee to provider (minus platform fee).
    → hook.afterAction: release transferAmount from hook to buyer.

Recovery:
  - reject: hook.afterAction returns escrowed tokens to provider (if deposited).
  - expiry: claimRefund (not hookable) refunds serviceFee to client.
    Provider calls recoverTokens(jobId) on hook to recover deposited tokens.
```

**Key properties:** (1) The provider cannot submit without depositing output tokens. (2) The buyer only receives tokens when the evaluator completes the job. (3) On rejection or expiry, tokens are returned to the provider.

---

#### Example 2 — Bidding Hook

**Problem:** A client wants to hire the cheapest (or best) agent for a job but does not know upfront who to assign. The selection should be determined by an open bidding process, not unilaterally by the client after the fact.

**Solution:** A `BiddingHook` that verifies off-chain signed bids. Providers sign bid commitments off-chain; the client collects bids, selects the winner, and submits the winning bid's signature via `setProvider`. The hook's `beforeAction` callback recovers the signer and verifies it matches the chosen provider — proving the provider actually committed to that price.

Zero direct calls to the hook. All interactions flow through the core contract → hook callbacks.

```
Step 1 — createJob
  Client → createJob(provider=0, evaluator, expiredAt, desc, hook=BiddingHook, payoutReceiver=address(0))
  Job created (Open), provider = address(0).

Step 2 — setBudget (opens bidding via hook callback)
  Client → setBudget(jobId, USDC, maxBudget, optParams=abi.encode(biddingDeadline))
    → hook.beforeAction: store deadline for this jobId.

Step 3 — bidding happens OFF-CHAIN
  Providers sign: keccak256(abi.encode(chainId, hookAddress, jobId, bidAmount))
  Client collects signed bids and selects the winner.
  Core contract is unaware of bids.

Step 4 — setProvider + setBudget (hook verifies winning bid signature and enforces budget)
  Client → setProvider(jobId, winnerAddress, agentId=0, optParams=abi.encode(bidAmount, signature))
    → hook.beforeAction: verify deadline passed, recover signer from signature,
      validate signer == provider, store committed bidAmount. Revert if invalid.
    → core: job.provider = winnerAddress
    → hook.afterAction: mark bidding finalised (no further setProvider possible).
  Client → setBudget(jobId, USDC, bidAmount, "")
    → hook.beforeAction: enforce budget == committedAmount. Revert if mismatch.

Step 5 — job continues normally
  Client → fund(jobId, bidAmount, "")
  Provider → submit(jobId, deliverable, "")
  Evaluator → complete(jobId, reason, "")
```

**Key property:** The client cannot fabricate a provider commitment. The hook verifies the chosen provider actually signed a bid at the claimed price. The client is incentivised to pick the lowest bidder since they are the one paying.

---

### Events

Implementations SHOULD emit at least:

- **JobCreated**(jobId, client, provider, evaluator, expiredAt, hook) — includes the hook address (`address(0)` if no hook)
- **ProviderSet**(jobId, provider, agentId) — when provider is set on a job that was created without one; `agentId` is 0 if not specified
- **BudgetSet**(jobId, token, amount) — includes the payment token address
- **JobFunded**(jobId, client, amount)
- **JobSubmitted**(jobId, provider, deliverable) — when provider submits work for evaluation
- **JobCompleted**(jobId, evaluator, reason)
- **JobRejected**(jobId, rejector, reason)
- **JobExpired**(jobId)
- **PaymentReleased**(jobId, provider, amount) — net amount paid to the provider on completion
- **PlatformFeePaid**(jobId, platformTreasury, amount) — only emitted when a non-zero platform fee is taken
- **EvaluatorFeePaid**(jobId, evaluator, amount) — only emitted when a non-zero evaluator fee is taken
- **Refunded**(jobId, client, amount)

Implementations that add admin tooling SHOULD also emit operational events (e.g. `HookWhitelistUpdated`, `PaymentTokenAllowlistUpdated`, `HookDetached`, `PlatformFeeUpdated`, `EvaluatorFeeUpdated`, `EmergencyWithdraw`) so off-chain indexers can track configuration changes.

## Rationale

- **Single attester after submission**: Once Submitted, only the evaluator can complete or reject; the client cannot pull funds back unilaterally, so the provider is protected after starting work. Evaluator = client covers the "no third party" case.
- **Explicit submission**: The Submitted state gives the evaluator (and indexers/UIs) a clear signal that the provider considers work done and ready for evaluation, separating "funded and in progress" from "work delivered".
- **Minimal surface**: Attestation is the optional `reason` on complete/reject; no additional ledger is required.
- **Four states**: Open, Funded, Submitted, and Terminal (Completed, Rejected, or Expired) are enough for "fund → work → submit → evaluate or refund".
- **Expiry**: Refund after `expiredAt` gives client a way to reclaim funds without an explicit reject.
- **Hooks over inheritance**: Optional hook contracts let integrators extend the protocol (validation, reputation, fees) without modifying or inheriting from the core contract. The core stays minimal; complexity lives in the hook.
- **Generic hook interface**: The `IERC8183Hook` interface uses just two functions (`beforeAction`/`afterAction`) with a selector parameter rather than named functions per action. This keeps the interface stable as the core protocol evolves — new hookable functions simply produce new selector values without changing the interface.

### Extensions (OPTIONAL)

The following extensions are OPTIONAL and do not modify the core protocol. Implementations MAY adopt them independently.

#### Reputation / Attestation Interop (ERC-8004)
 
Agentic Commerce is intentionally minimal and does not embed a reputation system. For on-chain reputation and trust relationships between agents, implementations are RECOMMENDED to integrate with [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md) (Trustless Agents).

The following patterns are RECOMMENDED:

- **Outcome‑based trust signals**
  - Each job outcome SHOULD be mapped into a trust signal for the participants:
    - `Completed`: positive signal for provider (and optionally evaluator) based on successful delivery.
    - `Rejected`: negative or neutral signal, depending on the reason and who rejected (client vs evaluator).
    - `Expired`: neutral or mildly negative signal for client (for not evaluating) or for provider (for not submitting), depending on higher‑level policy.
  - Implementations MAY emit ERC‑8004 compatible events or call ERC‑8004 registries when a job reaches a terminal state.

- **Evaluator attestations**
  - On `complete(jobId, reason, optParams?)` and `reject(jobId, reason, optParams?)`, the evaluator (which MAY be a contract) SHOULD:
    - produce an attestation or structured log that can be added to the ERC‑8004 **reputation registry** as feedback (e.g. "provider successfully completed job", "job rejected for reason X"). Attestations MAY reference the job, parties, and `reason` (e.g. a hash of off‑chain evidence).
    - and/or post a proof to the ERC‑8004 **validation registry**, which a hook (or evaluator contract) then reads in order to decide whether to mark the job as `Completed` or `Rejected`.
  - Hooks MAY be used to call into ERC‑8004 registries in `afterAction` for `complete`/`reject`, keeping the core ERC-8183 contract unaware of the registry details.

- **Reputation‑aware policy via hooks**
  - Hooks MAY consult ERC‑8004 data before allowing certain actions, for example:
    - preventing `setProvider` from assigning providers below a reputation threshold,
    - enforcing higher budgets or additional safeguards for low‑reputation agents,
    - dynamically selecting evaluators based on reputation.
  - Such checks belong in policy‑oriented `beforeAction` hooks so they can safely revert and block actions that violate reputation policies.

- **On-chain identity binding via agentId**
  - When `setProvider` (or `createJob`) is called with a non-zero `agentId`, the job stores `providerAgentId` on-chain. This enables direct identity binding: hooks and evaluator contracts can look up the provider's ERC‑8004 agent record without off-chain mapping.
  - Reputation writes (e.g. on `complete` or `reject`) can reference the stored `providerAgentId` to attribute outcomes to the correct agent identity in the ERC‑8004 registry.

- **Separation of concerns**
  - ERC-8183 remains the **payment and escrow** layer; ERC‑8004 is the **identity and reputation** layer.
  - Interop is achieved by:
    - storing the provider's `agentId` on the job for direct identity lookup,
    - emitting events that ERC‑8004 indexers can consume, and/or
    - calling ERC‑8004 contracts from hooks or evaluator contracts.

#### Meta-Transactions / Facilitator Relay ([ERC-2771](./eip-2771.md))

To support gasless execution — where a client, provider, or evaluator signs an intent off-chain and a **facilitator** submits the transaction on their behalf — implementations SHOULD support [ERC-2771](./eip-2771.md) (Secure Protocol for Native Meta Transactions).

**How it works:**

1. A participant (client, provider, or evaluator) signs a meta-transaction off-chain (e.g. `createJob`, `fund`, `submit`).
2. A facilitator submits the signed payload to a **trusted forwarder** contract.
3. The forwarder verifies the signature and calls the ERC-8183 contract, appending the original signer's address.
4. The ERC-8183 contract uses `_msgSender()` (from `ERC2771Context`) instead of `msg.sender` to identify the caller.

**Implementation requirements:**

- The ERC-8183 contract SHALL inherit `ERC2771Context` (or equivalent) and use `_msgSender()` for all authorization checks (`client`, `provider`, `evaluator`).
- All role checks (e.g. "caller is client", "caller is provider") SHALL use `_msgSender()` rather than `msg.sender`.
- The trusted forwarder address SHALL be set at deployment and SHOULD be immutable.

```solidity
import {ERC2771Context} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol";

contract ERC8183 is ERC2771Context, ... {
    constructor(address trustedForwarder, ...)
        ERC2771Context(trustedForwarder) { ... }

    // Example: fund() using _msgSender() instead of msg.sender
    function fund(uint256 jobId, uint256 expectedBudget) external {
        Job storage job = jobs[jobId];
        if (_msgSender() != job.client) revert Unauthorized();
        if (job.budget != expectedBudget) revert BudgetMismatch();
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Token approvals:** For functions that pull tokens (e.g. `fund`), the signer SHOULD use [ERC-2612](./eip-2612.md) (`permit`) to approve token spending via signature. The facilitator can then call `permit` and `fund` in a single transaction — no on-chain approval tx needed from the signer.

**x402 compatibility:** This extension enables compatibility with HTTP-native payment protocols such as x402, where an AI agent signs payment intents off-chain and a payment facilitator handles on-chain execution. The agent only needs a private key and tokens — no gas, no RPC management, no chain-specific logic.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation consists of two contracts: `IERC8183Hook`, the optional and minimal hook interface that developers implement, and `ERC8183`, the core Job primitive with escrow and optional hook extension points.

## Security Considerations

- Evaluator is trusted for completion and rejection once the job is Submitted; a malicious evaluator can complete or reject arbitrarily. Use reputation (e.g. [ERC-8004](./eip-8004.md)) or staking for high-value jobs.
- Once Funded, only the evaluator can reject, and only the provider can submit; the client cannot unilaterally withdraw, which protects the provider after they start work.
- No dispute resolution or arbitration; reject/expire is final.
- Per-job payment tokens increase flexibility but also expand the attack surface; implementations SHOULD validate that payment token addresses are legitimate ERC-20 contracts (e.g. via an allowlist or registry check) to mitigate risks from malicious token contracts.
- **Reentrancy:** Functions that transfer tokens SHALL be protected (e.g. reentrancy guard).
- **Tokens:** Use SafeERC-20 or equivalent for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).
- **Evaluator:** MUST be set at creation; if "client completes", pass `evaluator = client`.
- **Hook gas limits** (for hooked implementations): Implementations SHOULD impose a gas limit on hook calls (e.g. `call{gas: HOOK_GAS_LIMIT}(...)`) to bound execution cost and prevent hooks from consuming unbounded gas. The specific limit is left to the implementation as gas costs vary across chains.
- Hook contracts are client-supplied and trusted by the client; implementations MUST NOT allow hooks to modify core escrow state directly. `claimRefund` is deliberately not hookable so that refunds after expiry cannot be blocked by a malicious hook.
- Jobs that use **advanced hooks** (e.g. two‑phase escrow / fund‑transfer hooks that custody additional tokens) are expected to have **more revert paths and tighter coupling** to external logic than plain, non‑hooked Agentic Commerce jobs. Such hooks SHOULD be reserved for agents and users who understand and accept this trade‑off; for most simple jobs, a non‑hooked or policy‑only hook is RECOMMENDED.
